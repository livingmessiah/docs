# Living Messiah Ministries PowerPoint Slide Deck

## Overview 
- The Main Service Power Point slide deck is the liturgy used by LMM during a Shabbat service.
- The slide deck is broken down into parts.  Each part is proceeded with a blank slide indicating that the focus is off the overhead and on the events of the worship as they  occur.  They are also helpful for the one changing the slides
 - There are two categories of parts **Static** (parts 1, 3-6) and **Dynamic** (*part 2: Prays and Worship*).  
 - **Part2: Prays and Worship** - the only Dynamic deck of slides
